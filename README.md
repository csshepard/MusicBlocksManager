## Music Blocks
A Raspberry Pi Based Music Box for my daughter.

Music Blocks was inspired by a project created by Shawn Kahandaliyanage called [Song Blocks](http://shawnrk.github.io/songblocks/).  As he puts it:
>I (Shawn Kahandaliyanage) built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos without apparently interacting with technology

The device includes wooden blocks with embedded NFC tags that when placed against a surface, play different songs depending on which block is used.

I liked the idea, but didn't have a Sonos.  With the help of my Father-in-law, I'm going to build a stand alone device that has the same functionality with installed speakers.

## Parts:
- Raspberry Pi Model B+
- [EXPLORE-NFC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/explorenfc)
- NFC Tags (I used GoToTags NXP NTAG203 Stickers)
- PC Speakers
- 12v Power Supply (Can use speakers supply if amperage is high enough)
- 5v Buck Converter
- 3/8" X 3-1/4" X 3' Hardwood Plank
- Wood for enclosure (will update after design is finalized)

## Design:
We've decided to build the player into a toy box that will be in my daughter's room.  The electronics will be inside a false front for protection.  The speakers will also be built into this false front towards the edges of the box.
